            "Spaghetti Bolognese is a classic Italian dish that is a favorite of many. To make it, start by heating a large pot on medium heat and adding a tablespoon of butter or olive oil. Add some minced garlic and diced onions and cook until softened. Add ground beef, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as it cooks. Once the beef is cooked, add a jar of tomato sauce, a can of diced tomatoes, a tablespoon of Italian seasoning, a teaspoon of sugar, and some freshly ground black pepper. Simmer for about 20 minutes and then add cooked spaghetti to the pot. Mix until combined and serve with grated Parmesan cheese.\u001b[0m\n",
